I love ultimate. I love computer vision. There is nothing else that can intersect these two the best. Tune in to find out.

#### Getting started
* Make sure that flask is installed ONLY on your virtualenv for this app. Flask will redirect to your local pip installation of flask when running the backend, so make sure that you have uninstalled any local flask package in your local pip directory.

* I will think of a better way to deploy venv dependencies. Long gone is the age of using a requirements.txt to establish dependencies. A pipfile ought to do for setup.
